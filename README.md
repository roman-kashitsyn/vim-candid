# Candid filetype plugin

[Candid](https://github.com/dfinity/candid) is an interface description language (IDL) for interacting with canisters (also known as services or actors) running on the Internet Computer.
This plugin provides very basic support for editing candid interface definition files (aka `.did` files).
